---

I’m an ardent politics buff, disgruntled movie fanatic, frustrated lover of literature, die-hard quizzer, and the occasional teacher. Presently, I’m a PhD Research Fellow at Gauhati University. My areas of specialisation are Displacement Narratives, Exile Literature, and Diaspora. I am also working as a Guest Faculty in B. Borooah College, Guwahati.

## Blog
Although I enjoy writing, at present I hardly get any time to do so. Burdened with research, academic assignments and work, the art within me is slowly fading. I am almost always in class- either taking one as a teacher or sitting in one as a student. Still at some rare occasions, whenever possible, I pen down my thoughts.
